# Adding simulations and experiments

Adding new data is described in detail in [the NMRlipids documentation](https://nmrlipids.github.io/). Please follow the instructions carefully for both simulations and experiments, filling metadata fields with meaningful and complete information.

If data addition requires a molecule that is currently absent, you are very welcome to add new molecules. Please be careful with modifying molecule information, mapping files of molecules as it could affect the recomputation of other contributors' data.

# Repository rules

1. You can add new data without referring to any issues.
1. Please keep main branch in your fork updated so that it can be rebased (we prefer rebasing over merging).
2. Once you address an issue, please refer it in commit message by using phrases like 'Partially fixes #000'.
3. We recommend contributors to squash commits if the changes are just adding new data.
4. We require at least one review from organisation member to accept a pull-request.
5. Check representation of yourself in `AUTHORS.md` file.
6. You are always welcome to participate in repository discussions and NMRlipids community events to develop data and code together.

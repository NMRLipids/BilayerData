# FAIRMD BilayerData
FAIRMD BilayerData is an on-github database of lipid bilayer structures operated by [FAIRMD Lipids](https://github.com/NMRlipids/FAIRMD_lipids) project. The database contains information about:
- experiments, namely form factor data from Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) experiments and order parameter data from <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C dipolar splitting or from <sup>2</sup>H quadruple splitting solid-state NMR (ssNMR) experiments
- MD simulations, run by different engines using various force fields
- molecules with their metadata

The database doesn't store raw data; we refer to public archives like Zenodo, where complete trajectories must be stored. The database structure is described in detail in [FAIRMD Lipids documentation](https://nmrlipids.github.io/FAIRMD_lipids/stable/dbstructure.html).

All the simulations from this database are mirrored at the [NMRlipids webUI](https://databank.nmrlipids.fi).

# Contribution
Every contribution, whether in experiments or simulations, is welcome! If you would like to contribute simulations or experiments, please follow [these instructions](https://nmrlipids.github.io/FAIRMD_lipids/stable/dbcontribute.html).

# Contacts
Project is run by NMRlipids Open Collaborations, please send your inquiries to [databank@nmrlipids.fi](mailto:databank@nmrlipids.fi).

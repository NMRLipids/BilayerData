SOLUTION_COMPOSITION:
  SOD: 1
ADDITIONAL_MOLECULES:
  DSS: sodium trimethylsilylpropanesulfonate, 0.9%
TOTAL_HYDRATION: 40
PH: UNKNOWN
REAGENT_SOURCES:
  TLCL: from Bovine heart, Avanti Polar Lipids
  water: Type I Milli-Q, degassed by argon bubbling
  DSS: Sigma-Aldrich
SAMPLE_PROTOCOL:
  TLCL_0H/Na+ (27.3mg, 1.0 eq.) and DSS (0.25mg, 0.06eq.) were dissolved with 1ml chloroform:methanol
  (7:3, v/v) in an Eppendorf vial. The solvent was evaporated at 40°C under a constant stream of
  argon and freeze-dried over night. 18.0µl degassed water was added and the Eppendorf was stored
  at 40°C for three days. Lost water was added and the sample was mixed thoroughly with a steel rod.
  After another two days of equilibration the sample was again mixed before packing the insert.

SAMPLE_PROTOCOL:
  TOCL/Na+(30.0mg,1.0 eq.) and TMACl(6.6mg,3.0eq.) were dissolved with2mlchloroform:methanol
  (2:1, v/v) in an eppendorf vial. A solution of TMA OHx5H2O (3.6mg, 1.0eq.) and BOH3 (1.2mg,
  1.0eq.) in 100µl methanol was prepared and added to the Eppendorf vial. The Folch method was
  performed and 0.4ml degassed water was added to the mixture. After an immediate phase separa-
  tion, the upper phase was discarded, the solvent of the lower phase was evaporated at 40°C under
  a constant stream of argon and the predried sample was freeze-dried over night. 32.4µl degassed
  water was added and the Eppendorf was stored at 50°C for one day. Lost water was added and
  the sample was mixed thoroughly with a steel rod. After another three days of equilibration the
  sample was again mixed before packing the insert.
